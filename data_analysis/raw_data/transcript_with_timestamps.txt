1
Speaker 1
00:00
Absolutely, yes!
2
Speaker 2
00:10
Jennifer Hernandez analytics for the same appropriate. And one thing that I really want to hear from you guys, so Appropriations have been process, which we're not going to get into the all the details of it, but I'm really curious, uh, to hear about the community process, but very, very good. Um, I understand that members, uh, circumcisions water school programs at. Yeah, they would like their representative support. And we're very curious with our wedding, uh, we understand that property, because from there, there is a member appropriation interaction and that was focused on report on this portal, and uh, because we notice that there's some water with this behind where I mean, I used to. We so many, okay, okay.
1
Speaker 1
01:45
Yeah,
2
Speaker 2
01:46
correct. Some other folks of the position to remember office? Yeah, and then, yeah. That's our office. Never access the committing and coming up. It's a bit more often more than one various exercise, um.
02:33
Are there opportunities to different movies? Yeah, see how ideas, I guess.
1
Speaker 1
02:51
Okay, yeah, so, so that's one subgroup. What are some other ideas or other topics about modernizing committees?
2
Speaker 2
03:09
Yeah, absolutely. Definitely
3
Speaker 3
03:10
happiness. The
4
Speaker 4
03:12
idea of monitoring democracy integrated in a more specific way so people know what's happened in their communities as a result, appropriately maximize the recovery Act Aura, uh, every one of those projects had a QR codes and Wooterrecovery.gov, the infrastructure spending
3
Speaker 3
03:32
Chips Act just chatting up people should be able to go to their community and see what's going on.
04:06
Great if one of the things that came out of this is?
4
Speaker 4
04:10
Some kind of Paradigm for how to make hearings, not just performative or social media, and C span. But to advance a predicate where you have?
04:27
Have extended discussions about trade-offs fall, and that might look like for staff for 30 minutes instead of members for five minutes. It might look like involving questions for constituents that might look like having different styles of hearing and selling. Modernization committee is done! Great work on this. So like, but right now, as of recovering journalist, Advocate citizen, our
3
Speaker 3
04:56
hearing.
1
Speaker 1
05:14
And Alex. Talking about how do we better monitor and do oversight and what I heard? Alex is, where do I as a constituent know what's happening in my district based on an active legislation? Time was funded, and so,
3
Speaker 3
05:30
and did my member vote for it?
1
Speaker 1
05:32
Yeah,
3
Speaker 3
05:33
because right now, there's unfortunately. Lack of honesty about that, and if something is actually having an impact on the community, then the members should be able to say yes. If it's not? Then they should be able to justify the vote.
1
Speaker 1
05:50
How can it be better and I? Nonpartisan staffer. I actually wrote this performance art versus schneeze getting the information communicating, right? As reality. Um, any other ideas that we wanted? Yes, can everyone say their name when they speak? I'm sorry, so Alex, can you go back and?
3
Speaker 3
06:20
Hi, I'm Alex Howard these days. Civic texts long time attendee occasional questions.
1
Speaker 1
06:26
Thank you,
5
Speaker 5
06:29
uh Omarawan, founder of Hill climbers. And I wanted to say, I'd like to see more. Uh, inter committee, like joint, not joint between Senate and house, but joint between the different committees on hearings. So, you know, my biggest gripe is the legislative. The ledge Branch or props committee. For example, they set the budget in February. For what members, you know, what the MRAs are going to be. And then, in October, November time frame Cha has to back, re-engine, reverse engineer those budgets where, if they kind of met together in February and did hearings together. They would be able to tell really quickly what the actual needs using actual. Like, if you go on hill climbers, we can tell you what you need.
07:16
For the MRAs for the next year and set those budgets there, so that by the end of the year, you're not having to like backtrack to a number. Instead, you're building to what the number should be the appropriate
4
Speaker 4
07:27
numbers because both committees work together.
1
Speaker 1
07:33
Thank you very much. What I heard was, you want more joint hearings or her hands. That means more shared work, and there's also some places that the house rules have shared jurisdiction.
2
Speaker 2
07:43
So I just added, that is, yeah,
5
Speaker 5
07:44
yeah. And
1
Speaker 1
07:44
then, but your specific focus is MRA budget process.
07:51
Any other ideas?
4
Speaker 4
07:53
Oh well, I guess to the hearing process point. It would be good to hear, um, kind of what. What is the major goal with the committee hearing, like, what are is the best outcome? Is it really just to get bills passed through? Is it to discuss subjects, and I got what other main goals when looking at kind of committee modernization.
1
Speaker 1
08:15
Yeah, so when we're so, who might have an answer for that? Um, I'm sorry,
4
Speaker 4
08:21
Nate.
1
Speaker 1
08:22
Um, so Nathan asks, what are the goals on the hearing? What? So, does anyone want to answer that question?
6
Speaker 6
08:29
Depends on us.
08:33
I mean, ostensibly, it should be to learn something you know for, um, the the committee, to hold a hearing on a topic. That the members want to learn more about and to be able to ask questions of expert Witnesses to gather the information they need to draft legislation or do more oversight or whatever, but? You know, that's sort of the textbook explanation, um? You know, the that's as, uh Alex, was saying, um, a lot of hearings these days are more performative than anything else. So, you know? That's the some members have that as a goal of, you
3
Speaker 3
09:10
know,
6
Speaker 6
09:10
making, um? Um statements that they can, you know, run on social media.
3
Speaker 3
09:15
Did any any members ever ask their constituents, what questions they want to ask?
6
Speaker 6
09:22
Um, yes, I'm
4
Speaker 4
09:24
sure that that's happening. Yeah, yeah. Um, sorry, uh, um, I actually think that the question of what hearings are for, in sort of, like the modern Congress is?
09:39
Like? Really open for debate. I think the sort of like current hearing format doesn't serve an enormously valuable purpose for all the time that we, as committee staff spend on them. And I do think that this is really a space where, like a legislative innovator, could come in and sort of, like, redefine what committees do. Um, in the modern American government in the modern Congress, and um, so incidentally, like one of the things we could discuss on that is. Or our ideas for, like, what that Innovation might look like, but I do think that? Um, like, modern method of the modern processes of committees are.
7
Speaker 7
10:16
Um, you know,
4
Speaker 4
10:17
they serve some useful purposes, but they they are sort of. It feels like there's more potential there than it's being.
10:26
But the possible exception of of? Places like the rules committee, the appropriations Committee like, have a pretty defined purpose.
6
Speaker 6
10:37
Suggestion.
8
Speaker 8
10:37
Yeah, as a suggestion, Tyler Clinton. I was for hearings. I think kind of a short-term, achievable goal might be the ability to tag or categorize a hearing ahead of time so that, like. The issue areas that the hearing is going to cover can be labeled and then used programmatically in other systems so that staffers can be find hearings that are relevant to their issue
9
Speaker 9
11:04
areas. Yeah,
7
Speaker 7
11:09
I'm Daniel same same idea, but further. Hearings in drafting legislation are they're iterative, right? You've done something, and then you're going to come back and do it again. There's going to be another hearing on this topic, or someone else had a hearing on this topic, or there's a CRS report on this topic, or if someone spoke on the fore on the topic.
10
Speaker 10
11:30
Um,
7
Speaker 7
11:30
but it's hard to find the pieces. If you, where's all the witness testimony? Where are the relevant committee reports? Where is there relevant, you know? You know, committee reports are voluminous. What if that is actual stuff that you would want to look at and what is, not, or?
10
Speaker 10
11:49
Um,
7
Speaker 7
11:49
you do a qfr a question for the record afterward. Well, can you find it? What was asked, how does it tie into what was questioning before, so you have this like long conversation that happens over time. But, like, it's like being a race like the memory of it's being erased over time. So, how can you if you want to understand what does multicast must carry, which is the most boring Telecom is. You can possibly imagine, right, like? But where has it been discussed and who knows about it, and what have they said? And can I pull together in, like, some kind of reasonable way, so it's
6
Speaker 6
12:21
not the
7
Speaker 7
12:21
hearing as a discreet thing, but as like, like one drop in, like the river of a conversation, almost
6
Speaker 6
12:28
like a search engine for the topic of all the follow-ups. Yeah.
1
Speaker 1
12:34
And so one of the things I wrote down. Is. One idea is label hearings with issue tags before and after convenience, and the other one is just. How do you find information because this game says we use and we use tax legislative tax kits. We find no break multiple progresses, and there might be multiple hearings to enact to actually get a policy idea, and so, um, like, how do you surface out over multiple years like,
4
Speaker 4
13:04
hi, Mike, uh, since FTC, um? I have a question. Like, where's the information? Or is there a central way of following Witnesses across, uh, like, like, we're? I've worked with Danielle, um, to work on, uh, that YouTube, the committee mapping data platform and part of that is understanding Witnesses and who's showing up and entity matching them and stuff. But like I was wondering, like as as people who run committees, where did the part of the witnesses come from? How do you keep track of them, like, is there? Yeah, what is? Can you explain that, yeah, I can.
1
Speaker 1
13:40
I'll start and then Mary, and from an Institutional standpoint, I know that it's a challenge for many staff to to find the way. Is, and have they testified before, because a lot of as well know, there's a lot of subject matter experts that come up with repeatedly, and so if if in these like jurisdiction area if someone testified five years on the same subject matter in the jurisdiction is on another committee on that topic. They want to know what that witness has said before before they get invited in trying to service that that and actually putting, you know, Wicked is on.
14:18
Okay, so that we can easily pull them out, particularly when people change organizations or change things is a challenge. I don't know, Marion, how do you have any experience or probably with hearing what this is and how to keep tracking? I don't,
6
Speaker 6
14:33
um, I'm not. I'm not really sure about keeping track of them. At JD, you've worked in this area.
4
Speaker 4
14:43
I'd say by and large committees don't keep track of that, and there's. There's certainly not a centralized, unique identifier across across entities and a question that. Some political scientists have tried to look at is like, we don't even know. Are there like the high, flat, high frequency Witnesses versus people show occasionally or just? So, there's a whole host of questions that like, have to better use Witnesses and the information they provide. But as far as I know, like? At least, you know, when we were recruiting Witnesses, it's like, oh, who can we Google and find, or do we know?
15:25
Um, and it's kind of flying by the seat of your pants.
6
Speaker 6
15:35
Or will be good in. The committee will be good in front of members that you call on, but for example, I got CHA. I don't think I don't know who's a frequent flyer at transportation and infrastructure, and maybe they'll be crossover there. Certainly, there's crossover with Judiciary on some of the stuff we do, and I don't know who they go to for everything. So that's something that there's not across communication with necessarily. It's just sort of. You call up your, your friends, and your former staffers. And you know, people who you work with? In the kind of outside spaces and?
16:10
I would say also just to back it up a little bit, um. I mean, I think the most, you know, the first, most important step is to talk to your, um, your chair, your ranking member, the members and ask, what story are you trying to tell here? Like, we know we're going to do a hearing on on Congressional capacity. What you know? What? What story are you trying to tell about it? You know what? What do you? What do you want to say about that and then trying to identify Witnesses who share that that perspective or have something interesting to say about that perspective?
16:44
Can add to it. Um, you know, because you don't want to set up a hearing with Witnesses who you know?
1
Speaker 1
16:51
Going to take a
6
Speaker 6
16:52
completely different perspective than what the, you know? The the committee members are? Are thinking of, so you want to start there, but I think with with a lot of committee staff because their subject matter expertise in the areas that they're. Um, they're working tend to have those connections outside of Congress. Like, I know, I know someone who studies this? I know, you know, people who would know people who do this and so, you know, just like Kali Hussein and JD kind of pull from, um? The pool of people who you know to be experts and have them give you suggestions, and then you, you know, of course, then want to talk to those people and see if, uh, see, you know, you think they'd make a good witness or read things that they've written. It's also, I can add something
2
Speaker 2
17:38
on there
6
Speaker 6
17:39
very dependent on who can actually make it to the hearing. Who can afford to come out here take time off?
7
Speaker 7
17:47
Um,
6
Speaker 6
17:47
who's already in the DMV? Especially since we don't have virtual hearings or anything anymore that also limits the pool, but I think is your arm upper question. Yeah, so.
4
Speaker 4
18:02
A little bit different to just talking about hearings. In particular, I think you mentioned tagged data someone brought up committee reports. Another thing that would be really interesting to investigate is just to better represent. The things are already being posted. So, for example, during the Appropriations process, the committee reports contain these really nice tables that summarize where the money is being appropriated to.
3
Speaker 3
18:29
It's a
4
Speaker 4
18:29
picture of an ASCII table, so someone went in and typed in the table, then took a screenshot of it and dropped it in the PDF. So, for anybody who's trying to consume that the host of machine learning models, you have to do just to overcome something that could be. So truly, you could just give us the CSV table. Give us the the asking table. I mean, that'll be better to process um, and then the other thing that's really challenging the similar vein. Is the actual linking of the? The account that's getting funded to what the rest of the government thinks of is that account, so it's really tough if anybody's ever tried to map budget to spend? It's really hard to figure out where does this actually end up, because the taxonomy of how one account is being labeled its title. Whether you know what is the Facebook, think about it. What is the OMB budget? Think about it. What is, you say, spending? Think about it. What does that Bureau that office actually pulled themselves?
5
Speaker 5
19:31
Um, you
4
Speaker 4
19:31
have to like. Know all of these different things and sometimes manually overwrite things because there's no unique identifier that's saying, like. In the text, or here's the account. This is how much you're getting funded. This is the expectation we've got about. Yeah,
1
Speaker 1
19:45
good stuff. We have, um, just one more minute. We'll grow on ideas, and then we'll decide if we need to break up in some groups, but I wanted.
20:00
Does a report like PDF is a problem? Can you describe it 100 accurately? I sit on a group on London on Monday afternoons with some of my colleagues from GPO to model. Report data. We're working on reports right now in USLM for a couple language spots. The immediate solution for the Committees is to post the different various parts of the report onto the committee repository on Dr hostaga in the preparations committee could mostly see us in CSV on the community deposit boards before the long, daily long-term roadmap is to get get. But if you identified it perfect?
20:46
Then that circulates right to axis because anyone with a screen reader.
4
Speaker 4
20:55
Uh, sorry. I just wanted to the like to the point of the Appropriations Committee code if they wanted to, but but somebody on their staff has to take time out of an existing very busy schedule to do something different than they've already done, and to get that approved, and then to do it. And then to do it in an ongoing basis, and um. This, like many other things like, um, like Universal labeling of witnesses, or um tracking down, sort of like hearings or attaching identifiers to to hearings or to Witnesses, or to specific testimony, or to reports all of this is.
21:27
Like, at least right now. Perhaps, some of these things can be taken off by by AI in the future, but at least right now. It's a staff capacity issue, um. And I mean, I think, like, really, the fundamental problem that communities are having right now is the fundamental problem that Congress is having right now, which is that we don't have the capacity to do the work that we need to do.
1
Speaker 1
21:46
This is a
7
Speaker 7
21:57
really rational data. This is like. We're beyond the committee, so oftentimes have a sense of what they've done in the past. Uh, so I went and I looked at all the this was fun. All the. Committees that had had experts write about the committee history.
3
Speaker 3
22:14
Uh,
7
Speaker 7
22:14
which was a weird task to do so. Like, there's a great history of the rules committee that was published in 1982. That was the last time it was published, and it's a great history. It was from 1980s. It's a great history of the House of Representatives, published in 1970 by a guy named George Galway. Um, there isn't a reflexive. I mean, there's like the annual or biannual like reports that they do, but there isn't this is what we've done or how we've changed what we do. So, there isn't this understanding of like? What is this committee for, or where has this committee been for? What is it accomplished, right? You look at the history of the oversight or the investigations Committee in the Senate, I think done, really interesting things.
22:53
But when you come in there and you're a new staffer or your new member, how would you? How would you know the history of the house admin committee, right? There's some really fun books to read about it, but like they're old, right, or non-official or weird in some ways, but like? So, so let me so like that. That, so like that, context making? Yeah,
6
Speaker 6
23:12
you know, one
7
Speaker 7
23:13
way we're talking about, like, how do you see it in data? How do they process a number of bills blah, blah, blah? How are their hearings, but there's also like, what is their sense of self, and are they asking for some expert or some way to come in? To say this is my analysis of what you've been doing, and I think that's useful. It's not data, but like, it's useful. It's like
5
Speaker 5
23:32
they could actually set little mini strategic plans for complete congresses as well,
4
Speaker 4
23:37
like defining what their mission is, and that
7
Speaker 7
23:41
kind of stuff. And the house does that they don't do it well. All the Committees in the house create plans okay, and then they report on their execution of their plans. Having read those, they're like.
23:56
We do. We do do them. Yeah, but but it's a pro forma exercise because it's a pain. But yeah.
1
Speaker 1
24:05
Right? So there's those committee activity reports and those monthly reports that go up on ch8 website, but you're saying something? Periodically, the gentleman just needs to do a committee Grant that has some updates on the committee process. There was. There is a pretty fairly new one for CJ's,
7
Speaker 7
24:25
yeah, from uh 2012 2013.
5
Speaker 5
24:28
Yeah.
2
Speaker 2
24:34
Yeah, yeah, so that's I think that kind of tied up is there. I just
4
Speaker 4
24:39
want to add to the witness man, the witness management part since you guys all gave great input is that I can imagine that being like a cohesive just scheduler for, like, for all meetings going forward, and not only that creates a source of Truth for who the who the witnesses are, and then also lets them lets you be like. This is the day he's the pui prioritize, and let's see who's available first. And that way, there's a source of truth, and you can also keep track of it moving forward, um. And also creates transparency, because then people see who's going to all the meetings and things like that, but that's just an idea.
7
Speaker 7
25:10
You build it off the witness disclosure form that most that the non-governmental Witnesses still
1
Speaker 1
25:16
have one. From my standpoint, one of the things that I like about what you've added, like, is we really have to have a centralized intake process for the witnesses to be fill out their children. Ask how much and?
25:34
Causes, given the committee's that kind of formal process to make it easier on the witnesses. So, right now, all that activity happens when you're a non-suppeted, witness happens over time because everyone is coming, right? So, I really, so we, that's definitely something that's on the ground anything. I, I guess it kind of, goes to
4
Speaker 4
25:55
the witness testimony, along with kind of Appropriations and intake of constituents, but it would be interesting to know if there's a way. Communities are gathering together kids to join feedback as they're actually developing legislation, not even like in a hearing model, but just in a hey, yeah, we had a focus school who reached out to, you know? 50 citizens about this topic that we're writing on, legislation for, and let's get there kind of a pulse. Check on on what they're doing.
1
Speaker 1
26:27
I mean, I think that happened. And do you have or Kylie? Do you have any?
6
Speaker 6
26:31
Oh, I was just gonna say that there's been, um? Um. The the natural resources committee sort of experimented with a platform to, uh, to collect. Yeah, like, public comment on a big Bill that they were working on, um, where you know constituents are members of the public who are interested in that issue area could go in and and comment on what they on different parts of the bill. Um, but to my knowledge, actually, I think, um Daryl Isa, used to do some of that, too. At oversight, I think that, like field hearings like committee field hearings, there's not from my experience.
27:11
Often a lot of opportunities for committee staff to interact with, like constituents. That typically falls on the member offices, so that's something that. You know committees, we kind of don't have constituents. So, that's something that staff only gets really hands-on experience when we do. Field hearings, which aren't
1
Speaker 1
27:33
like
6
Speaker 6
27:33
regular opportunities, and they're expensive and kind of a pain in the ass to do, but they're worth it.
8
Speaker 8
27:39
Um,
6
Speaker 6
27:39
and I think that, I mean, that's like the only experience I've had.
1
Speaker 1
27:43
Okay,
2
Speaker 2
27:43
so let's I'm watching the clock. We got Jen over here to watch and talk about
1
Speaker 1
27:50
intake process for Appropriation, so we know that definitely is going to be a breakout group. Um, is anyone feeling really strongly about any of these other things from the Jamaica or something for breakup? Or should we just go write down a list and going more detail? I, I think hearings.
6
Speaker 6
28:10
Is kind of one. One group like hearings, Witnesses, joint hearings. Maybe data like managing? Yeah,
1
Speaker 1
28:20
that
6
Speaker 6
28:20
feels like one little circle and an oversight committee print reportings, all sort of a public disclosure in general. Was, like, maybe another group.
28:37
You all would just prefer to talk about it. Yeah, exactly. It's, it's for you all. It's not for us,
1
Speaker 1
28:42
it's for
6
Speaker 6
28:42
what you all think is. We could start with
5
Speaker 5
28:44
the bullet at the bottom capacity. Can you explain that again? I feel like we miss it.
4
Speaker 4
28:50
Yeah, yeah, happy to. So, I mean, basically like. Anybody who spent any amount of time working in or around Congress. I think sort of understands that, like everybody who's working on the hill wears a lot of hats. We do a lot of jobs, um. I don't know a lot of people around here who only work 40 hours a week. And I think that that is like, there's a sort of desire to to, like, glorify the work effort. And I think that there is something to be said for sort of being zealous. And you know, in public service, but also?
29:20
Um, that as a result of the fact that most people are doing two or more people's jobs? And that is a result of. Decisions, intentional or otherwise, that Congress has taken to under-resource itself relative to the rest of the government. So, our staff sizes are too small. Our salary pools are too small and our ability to sort of, like, take in and Implement technology. So, that is improving, especially on the house side, um, is, is underfunded. Yeah, so
5
Speaker 5
29:46
that definitely ties in with that MRA, but your processing it for me. You know,
1
Speaker 1
29:51
what do you think? Jen, you want to come down, and actually, as I hear everybody
2
Speaker 2
29:58
talking, I mean, I think there is, and maybe it could be time to, um? The constituent member conversation. Um, it seems like there is a need to have a standardized intake process. That wool facility, getting data from constituents, and then later for the member offices, then push that data into the member portal, which is. The portal that we work on and get a submissions from. So, thinking from, you know, if ultimately, you guys want to keep a conversation of, like everybody, kind of like throwing out ideas. I think that is something that I would find, um.
30:39
Interesting and useful. Um. And just kind of tying into the. As you're mentioning reports, there are multiple systems that are also used within a committee, so you have to throw in a number. Here, you have to throw in a number there, and those systems are not necessarily communicating with each other, um, so that might be something that maybe has to do with this as well, writing that modernizing portion of make sure that our systems that are the source of Truth and the HEPA data can actually communicate with each other and easily just transfer information from point A A.
31:12
We mean to point C as opposed to having to have a human. Which creates room for error have to sit down in front of the machine. And, like, it's like, okay, I'm gonna put this number here. And then, I'm gonna put it again in a different system. So, that's, that's an option. Yeah, well,
4
Speaker 4
31:29
it's it's part of the appropriation submission group, right?
6
Speaker 6
31:32
Yeah, unless we want to just combine them. Yeah, combine them. I mean, if? Just to the probes like?
2
Speaker 2
31:43
Can
7
Speaker 7
31:43
you find out when they're opening to receive requests? Because every member office does it
6
Speaker 6
31:49
at a different time,
4
Speaker 4
31:50
right? So right,
7
Speaker 7
31:52
so there's sorry,
2
Speaker 2
31:53
yeah, so that that becomes tricky every year, right in theory. We would get the president's budget, and then we're able to open the court, but it's happened that we're not getting like the budget is not presented in February. It's
6
Speaker 6
32:11
just presented later on the year, which kind of creates like a weird situation, because then members still submit their
2
Speaker 2
32:16
request, and they might say, like, yeah, you support the president's budget or I don't, but you don't really know what? That's what it is. So, that's, that's one thing. So, we kind of depend. Sometimes, we went around to see if. Budget comes out to give members time to look at it. Uh, past couple of years. It hasn't been the case, and it's, it's a weird schedule where we're kind of waiting. And then, all of a sudden, it's like you just have to go into a variation season, so it just quickly in a matter of weeks. Open up a portal
7
Speaker 7
32:49
so, and you get members like it's even. You could have members of the Appropriations Committee that that are that will each themselves start taking requests at different times. So it is, you know, like, you have to run on the back end, the process to work it for? You could have seven members on the particular subcommittee and one will start taking the request on February 1st and some will start doing it on February 15th, and they're all doing it as part of the same process. But you don't, you don't know when they open it either. They send an email to let you know, or you have to call them to let you know. And then all other forms are subtly different, which is lots of fun. Yeah, so, like,
2
Speaker 2
33:30
if
7
Speaker 7
33:30
you want to set, you know, and you're done with the form is going to look like until you see it. And then, it's, oh well. No, you need to say the same thing, but? Slightly differently. We're here going to use a drop down here. You're going to fill in the field, so there's lots of like, right? You like, yeah, no,
4
Speaker 4
33:43
do
2
Speaker 2
33:45
we
4
Speaker 4
33:45
think there's a lot of constituents who run into that? I understand why, someone you know? Someone in DC, who's communicating with seven different members of a subcommittee, none of whom represent them but work on their issue, might care about it, but is that really like a constituent intake issue, which is, like, I have an interest in my States why I'm reaching out to my member who does, you know, to submit this, you know? Yeah, it depends
7
Speaker 7
34:08
on. So, if you want to build a bridge across? Five districts, right? You're still dealing with, you know, and you represent the MTA or whatever the transit authority is. You're still dealing with multiple members who are appropriators for the same thing like, or you could be a community service group where you like your Meals on wheel. Well, whatever, whatever it is right, you're providing, uh, you visit the elderly, and you do it in all of the districts, so you communicate into all of the appropriators. So it is, you know?
4
Speaker 4
34:38
It's
7
Speaker 7
34:38
not. You know, like a random person in the district, it's usually someone who. An intermediary, its Association. It's a non-profit. It's something that is doing this in multiple places, and it's a Time tax, right? If you're, if you, if you represent Exxon Mobil and you want to put in like requests in all the members, you can certainly do it, but if you're at a small non-profit, then it's harder. So, like, there's definitely like.
4
Speaker 4
35:05
A
7
Speaker 7
35:05
design process for that, and then there's so awesome. Yeah, um, Kylie,
4
Speaker 4
35:11
like, I just want to clarify, you were saying, hearings, more joint hearings and Witnesses are one group, and then Appropriations are a second group, and then oversight would be a third potentially, I think so, but
6
Speaker 6
35:21
it's up to. It's up to you all. What you think is the best. Yeah, for your
3
Speaker 3
35:26
combo.
1
Speaker 1
35:30
We have to present a stage at 4, 20. So which is different.
35:37
Break out, and I would. I would really stay with them, but I feel like going if if I can keep us on time, I kind of like talking about each of these in sequence. Just like if I'm wrong, okay. But let me if you would like to do we have anyone? Oh, so
4
Speaker 4
35:53
we had a great questions. We had a question over here.
36:12
Yeah, I think we should
6
Speaker 6
36:12
just do them all. Like, yeah, as a group when I heard when I, when I felt really fascinating
1
Speaker 1
36:18
about Jen, is like, do, does progress need a general feedback?
36:30
There's an open space you can throw and come and apparently does a member fundamental. You need that kind of portal and then screen out through high values, then, and how does that then feed? You know, upcoming bubbling up from that would then be the corporations request, and then how does the matter office getting equipped to fill out a standardized four, right? And so that's the constituents on the stream, but then you have with dance to point out, too, is that there's the subject matter expert on the field, or that the regional representative that's going to work with how manyever Representatives are from that region on a particular.
37:16
Project. So, like a water project or a transportation project or something that everyone is kind of an agreement, but this Coalition is going to, you know, and so I don't. Any comments?
2
Speaker 2
37:31
Yeah, and one thing I wanted to add to that is you were mentioning, like the tax on on staff so I can tell you from a committee perspective as well. Um, you know? There's a deadline to submit a specific request for a specific, uh, something. And maybe you know? The deadline ends two weeks out three weeks out. We know because we look at the system. Uh, uptake. Play the usage that filter waiting until the day of deadline. A couple of hours before we close the portal to actually submit the information, and we know because people are doing so many different jobs and many too many different things that sometimes it's like junior or like freshman staff.
38:20
They get tasked with submitting. With the information, which makes it extra confusing for them because, you know, I. I understand that the forms already confusion. It's confusing to start with, and if you're not familiar with the information and you're told, like, hey, you have to fill this out now, it just becomes that much harder for you. And if you have to gather information from? Something that you got from a constituent or something that you got from a group. Then you copy and paste, and you submit right, like? At the end of the day, you just want to make sure you submit the work.
38:53
And then you'll figure out what comes after. So, um, I know, that's a component, um of it, as well. Um, just briefly, you mentioned all the different, like account names. Trust me, I'm going through that nightmare myself, and that is an internal. Institutional. A conversation, right, where not just us in Appropriations, but our partners, the CBO. We need to figure a better way of how we tie the data together. A lot of the systems that we use, and I think pretty much the systems that most people use. Our own systems from like a decade at least old, right? So that needs to be changed. Like, the process was looked at, perhaps differently, or you didn't have the ability to aggregate data or people didn't have really the vision to aggregate data. The way that we have it now.
39:45
So, there is a need there as well. How can we? Thai information that might flow from committee to committee or from institutions to institution. How can we make it easier for us to ingest it and then export it or shared.
8
Speaker 8
40:03
Um, it's been a little bit since I've dealt with these people. What is the you were sort of asking about the process of constituent to member requests, right? Like, so, what is the current status is that every member does it differently, or like, okay, so?
2
Speaker 2
40:19
We don't like us in Appropriations. We are not involved in that process at all, um. Every member has the ability to do the process whichever way. So,
8
Speaker 8
40:30
um. Like, kind of part of the like, I've been in space a lot and. I know that every time, like a member office, will come to us with like requests to do these things. As a developer, I know that. Always loved it when there's somebody else has done some work ahead of time, and I could just push the data onto an official place rather than have to, like, you know, come up with all of the rest of the stack, and so, like, yeah, especially with, like your member websites, like you can, you can easily have a form create on the member website that sends data to like, like three places, if need be, like, yeah, so?
41:10
I think that might be definitely one of the solutions.
1
Speaker 1
41:15
Yeah, I mean, I've heard at least from my experience at an office
2
Speaker 2
41:19
that
1
Speaker 1
41:20
members do post a forum in their website or at least some, and then they have a deadline for that. But then people continue to ask, for example, through email about certain things. They want Appropriations for, like, right now, we're getting like, that's our number one email things. It's just Appropriations for this for this. For that, I'm not sure how that is filtered after. I feel like there's also that sense of time. Made things, of course, effective because, like, yes, there's just form, and this is what people want. But this is also what people want, but this is coming through emails and then emails have to be bashed. And then you don't have time to look through every email, so I feel like, yeah, there's, I mean, that whole issue with timing emails in general also.
5
Speaker 5
42:04
To take something from other countries.
4
Speaker 4
42:09
Uh,
3
Speaker 3
42:09
petition platforms are part parliaments elsewhere, and when a petition gets enough support, then there's something concrete like your bill gets a vote on the floor. If you're talking about situent services or Appropriations, or something else where there's a mass group of constituents? Figure out how to identify them as constituents and then let them vote on petitions. And then Circle back. Like what? What disconnect is there that that isn't happening in our country? Besides the inability to seed power to your constituents to Define what your agenda is, I mean, that's my assumption why we don't have that Federal levels because you've never seen an office willing to be that open about ideation where there's a policy hook on the other end.
42:57
Um, but my assumption is that that feedback loop happens, and people see that their participation matters and that something happened as a result that they'll come back to it and talk about it. And it's not an abstract. Other countries do this.
4
Speaker 4
43:12
So, so just the the sort of note that I'll I'll say there, and I feel like I like, this is the last time ever, I will bring this up, I promise. But like that, actually, I, to me, sounds more like a capacity issue than the point that you just write sounds more like the capacity issue than it does like. An issue of necessarily being willing to relinquish power, I don't know. Like, on the institutional level,
5
Speaker 5
43:30
okay, but
4
Speaker 4
43:31
on the individual member level. I like there was no way that there wouldn't be more innovating. There's no way like we already see members with really Innovative sort of strategies to engage with their constituents, and there'd be a lot more more. Ability to. To sort of invest in kind of. You know, experimental ideas, untested ideas. The the thing is, is that right now? Like, staffs are so underfunded. So, under resourced that, like, they're just doing what they know works because they need to get they sort of, like, need to get through. And, yeah, the suggestion, then
3
Speaker 3
44:01
the top level is double funding for the legislative branch. If you want, like I'm all for constraints,
4
Speaker 4
44:08
but let's
3
Speaker 3
44:09
be serious. How about a stealth bomber for the ledge Branch? Yeah, how much of a difference would that make? I mean, I think the reason there's so much. Is there isn't enough resources to go around? So, if more money, you won't hear me disagree,
4
Speaker 4
44:23
right? Yeah. I
3
Speaker 3
44:24
mean, but but
4
Speaker 4
44:25
I will say sorry, just on that. Note, I mean, you know, the the figure that that, like folks, who who harp on like me who harp on this capacity issue is that you know the legislative branch in its entirety has about the same funding as the Department of Commerce? Rfda, yeah, and we're expected to oversee, you know, the entire, like the entire? Apparatus of the executive branch.
3
Speaker 3
44:48
And
4
Speaker 4
44:48
to produce legislation, which by the way is actually should have been the first thing I said.
1
Speaker 1
44:54
A regulations, you know, probably comment, kind of like portal like to do for proposed regulations. You're right, they have enough staff in the executive branch. So, even for us institutional, if you support the Committees and feed out the bad, really good like that right back gets down, but something that we Daniel and then
7
Speaker 7
45:20
so two quick things one there's? The development that I think about the nicotine of Case Compass. Which is an effort in part to mine all of the constituent communication data and to surface it, not just for the individual member office, but to take. Uh, aggregated, anonymized data and apply it to look at it, like across the house. Um, you know, and that is more in terms of, like, maybe other things. So, it's not like to what Alex's point is, like? You know, maybe it applies to the fact that there? You know, there's no bridge to get over the river in your in your neighborhood, and it's creating commutes like, so there could be complaints around that that may show up in the data or or health outcomes, or VA that benefits problems. So, like, maybe that ties into approach. But like there is this effort to try to pool some of that data. So maybe there are other ways to tie some of the other?
46:16
Constituent intakes like this isn't. This is an Appropriations request, but it's a demand signal, and we haven't made good use of that that demand signal right,
4
Speaker 4
46:25
and someone
1
Speaker 1
46:26
asked about. Hearing Witnesses and whatnot. When you have a lot, a number of committees and members of committees will use that casework as a that brings this person who I've had casework there. So, that's why my case competence is really important because a lot of times, a number of committees only have public witness or, you know, public, not public Witnesses, but? Public Employees.
46:55
Federal employees
7
Speaker 7
46:56
yeah, and the second point I was going to make is there is also no great way for. There's no, so there's no obvious way, maybe for experts and others to directly communicate with the Committees. So, in other countries, so in the United Kingdom, there's training for experts to communicate with Parliament in ways that Parliament can actually understand. Empowerment will put out questions that go through a body that they have to translate those questions to their experts around the country. If I want to file a comment with the house administration committee on a thing, I go well, either. I know the staffers, or I go on legistorm, and I look up a name, and I'm like this seems like it's the right name, boom, right? And
10
Speaker 10
47:36
that's not. And then, and then it's not public unless
7
Speaker 7
47:39
I put it on my website. So, like there, isn't that? Yeah. Feedback loop a little bit. It's all stopped. Yeah.
1
Speaker 1
47:48
What you're talking about is the hearing so that we can stay on track. So, I have a new. I have a new
5
Speaker 5
47:54
timing. We still have this. Yeah, we have
4
Speaker 4
47:57
it here. Alex, I'm sorry, all right. Yeah, no worries. Well, I guess to Alex's point, though I feel like even regulations.gov, like. There's like a million comments. Amen. Right on everything, and like the whole process like, there's no, there's no, like, aggregation, public aggregation of that, commenting where, like, an idea can be refined over time in public. Like, if, like stat, if that could like, there's like, one idea that everybody thinks is great, like staffers will just contribute to that in, like a public domain, with experts right, um, and the other question I had is like, I remember when Tokyo and Senate of tropes had some type of like approach.
48:36
Efforts. I don't know, really, really what it did, um? Maybe you guys are more familiar with it, but I think it was like around structuring like a probes data. It's like, did that go anywhere. It's
6
Speaker 6
48:45
it's
5
Speaker 5
48:45
ongoing.
4
Speaker 4
48:46
Anybody knowing about that,
2
Speaker 2
48:47
oh, I'm sorry.
4
Speaker 4
48:48
I cleaned Tokyo, the center. Yeah, yeah,
2
Speaker 2
48:51
we weren't very close with Clint, um. There are many things we want to do. It's the time. Because. There are a lot of other more pressing needs. Or the release are seen as more pressing needs so? We have
6
Speaker 6
49:08
a lot of things in the background.
2
Speaker 2
49:09
Oh yeah, he's he's excellent. He's great. Yeah. A
4
Speaker 4
49:15
plug for nonpartisan clerks.
49:20
In terms of the public comments regulations, that was something that, like, that's what my president Davidson was on. And, like, our goal is to build like a platform to let you explore and sort of bubble Up the like clusters of of cont like, comment, sentiment across dockets and stuff so. Um, that's no one's really doing. It seems especially regulatory comments, it seems to be under resource space. Like, if there's like a public, you know, like, easy thing for that, like, maybe CAO can pilot it or better offices or something, yeah? Oh, I was just gonna say there might also be like a kind of drawing some threads together a.
50:02
Middle Point, like a jumping in point that's easy, rather than opening up to a million petitions that staff don't have time to sort through. Creating a new post office, which is what I'm guessing, referring to in the UK. Another thing the UK does that? I think committees could benefit, and by hearing more from people is. Committees can over there, have a platform where they can selectively put out questions that they want to hear from experts, or they want to hear from the public, so it's not all the time live. Hey, we have this hearing coming up on this subject. Tell us what you think, and we only want to hear from experts who we only want to hear from this state that is impacted by these kids policy and and that could be like a.
50:55
Getting people used to this idea quite.
3
Speaker 3
50:58
In fact, how do they do that? How do they ensure that all the constituents know about that RFI. I
4
Speaker 4
51:04
mean, it's a it's a public website, so I think, how does the public know anything about not what government does?
1
Speaker 1
51:13
About that idea, too, is how do we break free all of the all of the funding that we go for? Research at University had pocketually funded the university, and we're paying with for taxpayer dollars. But then he gets kind of payable, and when you suggested great debit. Have you set your research paper to your member of Congress? You're like, well, I can't. It's a paywall. No, we paid for it, it should. That's just better expectation if it needs to be brought to Farmers. Anyways, that's my so far.
5
Speaker 5
51:43
Repose something, too, that can actually help with three of the problems. Um, with the approach submission. Also, with capacity of staff and what you were just talking about. And there's tools out there like ideation tools and what it does. Is it basically crowdsources and puts all the work onto the actual would potentially onto the constituents that you can say, okay. Well, in this District, you know, what are the, what are the ideas for the next appropriation. Like, what do you want to see and other constituents can upvote or down? Vote ideas, add their own ideas, and they can get up there really quickly, and then same thing with um, with what?
52:25
Talking about which I just got thrown off, maybe? You think a similar thing like their municipalities and larger areas of like New Zealand and Australia and all that have done this and where you know where people that live in a particular District they can actually put in? Hey, I want to fix this pothole on the street and other constituents can vote that up, and whoever gets the most votes on it, you know? They, then, the department of whatever that fixes,
4
Speaker 4
52:52
bottles,
5
Speaker 5
52:53
sees that, and then they can actually prioritize. This one is the one we want to go fix right now, so simil. You know, it can. It can solve the capacity a bit because it can actually have the constituents answering the priority kind of questions and all that. You can also do the questions for you, know which questions do we do? You want to ask the next Witnesses of the hearing, and they can similarly ideate that up for you. And you can have, like, top list of 10 questions, no work needed, although. The staff do need more money.
1
Speaker 1
53:26
Okay? Like two minutes more of a discussion, then we have to pick who's going to present on stage left. So, anyone who hasn't had a comment in that. In common, anyone want to add anything to the discussion if you haven't had a chance?
53:50
You want to present on stage. Sure,
5
Speaker 5
53:54
I can present a couple of ideas.
54:03
I, I can talk to the probe submission process and the hearing a little bit on the hearing process of the joint hearings and capacity of staff, but the other stuff you know something like annual
9
Speaker 9
54:14
arms?
8
Speaker 8
54:17
I just I just wanted to, uh,
5
Speaker 5
54:28
I don't want to go up.
8
Speaker 8
54:29
I, I just wanted to, uh, sort of bring back quick discussion about, um, metadata for hearings, and like, you know, having, you know, issue areas or topics, or even a like the, uh, forget the word, but but? Yeah, the individual communities. They all have their jurisdictions like what? What part of that jurisdiction is that being covered, and that sort of thing, like having that as metadata. And then, for Witnesses like, I'd love to be able to incorporate the ability to see all of the hearings and then choose a witness and then see all of the ones that they were like, you know, so
6
Speaker 6
55:06
someone could talk about that, like the data aspect of it. I guess all about the data,
4
Speaker 4
55:16
um? Like you mentioned, like extra Medina, and then outputting tables at csps. So say your name again, John jock. John. Um, I'm I'm obviously capacity is like the most important thing out of all of this, but like. Not to, not to focus on what I wanted, uh. But witness management, I think like, would be also like a
6
Speaker 6
55:40
part. Yeah,
5
Speaker 5
55:41
okay. It's
4
Speaker 4
55:45
like a tangible.
5
Speaker 5
55:47
Age, right?
1
Speaker 1
55:47
Fine, we
5
Speaker 5
55:48
are gonna have the Whiteboard on the stage.
1
Speaker 1
55:49
Do you want me to put the Whiteboard up there? Yeah, I'll carry it up.
4
Speaker 4
55:53
Yeah, I got it. Don't forget
3
Speaker 3
55:55
to double ledge Branch appropriate.
6
Speaker 6
55:57
Yeah, yeah, we should just say that. Yeah, it's not, not sure,
4
Speaker 4
56:01
all right, ten times.
6
Speaker 6
56:02
Ten time,
4
Speaker 4
56:02
no doubling. We do it.
5
Speaker 5
56:04
Okay, the triple
8
Speaker 8
56:05
and then settles them.
1
Speaker 1
56:11
Um, well,
6
Speaker 6
56:13
no, it's a great hearing. All these ideas, and um, hopefully we can figure out ways to get the ball rolling on some of this stuff. I, I know, we are doing work on the data aspects of it. Uh, Kirsten is very much involved in in that, um. And for my part, I will continue to push the, you know, different ways of of making hearings more usefulness? They did
1
Speaker 1
56:41
request us to do a slide one side deck, but I don't know if I have anything understand that, so we'll just like you said, I'll take the PowerPoint out there, and I can.
4
Speaker 4
56:52
How many minutes do we have left? I can try to put a slide to get, I can try to put one together right now if you want. To get it for them.
