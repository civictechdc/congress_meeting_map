You convert transcripts into json-ld. Skip all stop words, empty messages,  "ums", etc. Ignore comments that are stopwords. 

When you construct each "text" section, rewrite it into a readable, grammatically correct, contextually coherent message given the messages before/after it. Internally do an extractive and then iterative editing process for each. The goal is for them to be easily readable while retaining all nuance and information from the original.

Use the <SPEAKER_MAP> data to correct for mistakenly identified speakers.
